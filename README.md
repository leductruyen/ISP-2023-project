# ISP-2023 project: Quantum Simulation of Renyi Entropy in Schwinger model
 
 ## Introduction

Quantum computing has emerged as a groundbreaking field with the potential to revolutionize various scientific domains, including computational physics. In this essay, we delve into a pioneering project that leverages quantum computing techniques to calculate the Renyi entropy in the Schwinger model. This project presents a novel approach that combines theoretical transformations, quantum algorithms, and computational methods to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of calculating Renyi entropy.

## The Schwinger Model and Its Transformation

The Schwinger model, a quantum field theory describing the dynamics of fermions in 1+1 dimensions, poses a significant challenge for traditional computational methods due to its complexity. To address this challenge, the project begins by transforming the Schwinger model from its continuum limit to a discrete limit using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This transformation serves as the foundational step, allowing for the subsequent application of quantum computing techniques.

## The Jordan-Wigner Transformation

To make the Schwinger model implementable on a quantum computer, the project employs the Jordan-Wigner transformation. This transformation is a crucial step in mapping fermionic systems onto qubit-based quantum computers. By using the spin chain formalism, the Schwinger model is adapted to the language of quantum circuits and quantum algorithms.

## Quantum Algorithms: VQE and Adiabatic Evolution

With the theoretical groundwork laid, the project proceeds to find the ground state of the Schwinger model. Two prominent quantum algorithms, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Evolution algorithms, are employed for this purpose. These algorithms allow for the efficient determination of the system's ground state, a crucial step in calculating Renyi entropy.

## Jordan-Wigner Transformation Operator and SWAP Method

Once the ground state of the Schwinger model is determined, the project introduces the Jordan-Wigner transformation operator. This operator facilitates the conversion of the ground state from the spin chain basis to the lattice site basis. By applying the SWAP method, the project computes the 2nd Renyi entropy. This calculation is a pivotal achievement as it demonstrates the project's capability to extract meaningful physical quantities using quantum algorithms.

## Result and further direction

The project produced a plot of the 2-nd RÃ©nyi Entropy in terms of a dimensionless mass parameter, which demonstrated the outcomes of two quantum algorithms in comparison to the classical diagonalizing approach. The project's results offer a significant advancement in the field of computational physics. We successfully implemented two quantum algorithms to simulate and calculate Renyi entropy in the Schwinger model. This achievement holds great promise for understanding complex quantum systems beyond the Schwinger model. Besides that, upgrading the quantum algorithm to make them more efficient and friendly with the current quantum computer is a prominent future direction as well.
